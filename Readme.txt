Description :
- It is an experimental project that I used to work on in order to learn and become a better java programmer.
- It has three parts : server, server center and client. Protocols used are TCP and UDP. For Internet multiplayer game the server sends his informations to the server center and any client can request a list of available servers from server center.
  LAN multiplayer games do not require a server center, clients can see and connect to LAN servers thanks to Broadcast feature.

Features :
- 2D Top down, real time shooter.
- Single/Multiplayer (LAN/Internet server).
- AI.
- UI with animations.
- 2D Physics : collision detection with static/dynamic objects.
- Multiple maps.
